                    <h4 class="header">Project Description</h4>
                    <p class="desc-text">This project pulls in Job postings and displays them in a nicer looking format.
                        I used React Router to generate dynamic URLs for each ID. I also added a light/dark theme and am
                        using <span class="code">localStorage</span> to hold the user preferences. You can search by
                        title, location, or the job type. The project was made in React Native and I decided to use
                        Fetch instead of importing Axios. I also created icons to show if the job was full time, part
                        time, or contract.</p>
                    <h4 class="header">Challenges</h4>
                    <p class="desc-text">One of the neat things I added was a function to the <span
                            class="code">GlobalProvider</span> that took in the date from the API and returned it in a
                        more readable format. For example instead of the date it would say a 2 Weeks ago for better
                        readability. Instead of keeping the function to the global scope of that particular script and
                        having to copy it and add it to another page that was also using it (the job description page) I
                        created a context to store the function for reusability.</p>

                        to do CSS effects. The page floats up like a feather. I also chose a light could-like color
                        scheme; this is all in theme with a pillow that is as comfortable as a cloud.</p>

                        automatically after a user exits and there is form validation animations. (The site is not
                        currently live because Netlify does not support PHP hosting but can be deployed on a remote

                    <h4 class="header">Unique Challenges</h4>
                    <p class="desc-text">this was my first PHP and MySQL project. Previously I was working on small
                        database and PHP projects such as an address book. This was my biggest PHP and mySQL project and
                        a challenge I faced was some of the logic involved in sorting through the database to find who
                        is a friend of the user as well as following, followers, and mutual friends. I achieved this by
                        using <span class="code">Array_intersect($followers, $following)</span> and <br><span
                            class="code">Array_diff($followers, $mutual)</span>. Then I iterated through each list.
                        Another issue was making sure that each array was countable so that it did not result in an
                        error if one list was empty. this was fixed by doing a check to see if it was
                        countable.<br><span class="code">if(countable(count($mutual)) $following : [ ])</span>.</p>

                        page. I used someone elses code for the counter but spent the time to understand it. This
                        particular counter used and ease out formula where <span class="code">easeOutQuad = (x) =>
                            x-(2-x)</span> where <span class="code">x</span> is the progress of the frames <br><span
                            class="code"> const progress = easeOutQuad(frame / totalFrames)</span> . My understanding is
                        that the closer the frames get to the end the slower they will count. I coded an <span
                            class="code">IntersectionObserver</span> to start the counter when it was in view. </p>
